# Survey Form
This is the README file for the freeCodeCamp survey form project. It includes information about the project, how to run it, and any additional notes.

## Project Description
This project is a simple HTML and CSS survey form created for freeCodeCamp. It collects information about user experience and preferences on the platform.

## Technologies Used
HTML
CSS

## Running the Project
Save the HTML file (survey-form.html) and the CSS file (styles.css) in the same directory.
Open the HTML file in your web browser.

## Additional Notes
The CSS file uses a background image for the form container. You can replace this image with your own by modifying the background-image property in the body::before rule.
The form uses various input types, including text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a text area.

## Further Development
Implement functionality to submit the form data.
Add validation to ensure users enter required information.
Style the form for different screen sizes more responsively.
Feel free to contribute to this project by making improvements or adding new features!
